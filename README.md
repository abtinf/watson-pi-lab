    [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account.

2. Click the button below to fork a template project into IBM DevOps

    [![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)][deploy2bluemix]

3. Follow the simple Bluemix steps and test the template application as-is. 

  Bluemix chooses a default name for your application, but feel free to change it.

  When prompted to select an organization, choose your own (it defaults to the email address used to register). Typically you will only have one space in your org, but if more available, select the one you prefer. 

4. Wait until the fork process and deployment to Bluemix finishes (it may take a couple of minutes).

5. Test the recently deployed template app with the link provided.
