      h2 About this application
      
      p The Investment Advisor Demo combines 
        a(href='http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/personality-insights.html') IBM Watson Personality Insights 
        span and 
        a(href='http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html') IBM Watson Tradeoff Analytics 
        span services to recommend suitable funds and agents for clients.

      p Fund recommendation is based on client's personality and risk profile.   Studies have indicated that risk preference of an individual is correlated  to some personality attributes such as Cautiousness and Stability. Each fund,  based on it's risk score is assigned a personality portrait. Investment Advisor  recommends funds which have similar personality portrait to client's personality.

      p Investment advisor recommends agents focusing on building a long-term   relationship with your clients. It uses client's personality to select the   best matching agent, as the closest personality match or best complementing   personality to handle this customer.
